# Final-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases all the projects I created over the semester using p5.js, reflecting the journey of exploration through coded throughout the course. Among these, there's also a special project I developed using Arduino and Python, which highlights the integration of hardware and software in a unique way.It focuses on empathy, vocal detection and Machine Learning. 

This semester has been an incredible learning experience. Compiling these projects together has allowed me to see my own growth, both technically and creatively. Yet also is a reminder of the countless challenges I had to overcome through the process of each proejct. Coding from scratch has really pushed me to keep going and staying resilient through it all. 

Feel free to explore and enjoy the work!
